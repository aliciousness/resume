# MY RESUME

This is my resume website hosted on s3 with cloudfront. I used a resume template i found online. I created the resource to host this website using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/). The [repository](https://github.com/aliciousness/new_website).

For the buildspec file, S3_BUCKET is the main bucket in environment i am hosting the website from. The environment variable is stored in the AWS CODEBUILD project.
